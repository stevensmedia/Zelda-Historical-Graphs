<h2>Important note</h2>
<p>There are technically two categories in this list. The runs by Darkwing Duck, and the runs by LackAttack24 immediately after him, were in a restricted category banning the use of Up+A death warps. Version differences may also complicate things, but were not known about at the time.</p>
